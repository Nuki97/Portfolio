                <h2>Ayomikun Awoyelu</h2>
                <p>My name is Ayomikun Awoyelu a.k.a Nuki. I am a Business Tech Management Student aspiring to become a successful Real Estate Broker and Entrepreneur. I am set to graduate in the Summer of 2022 and continue my Real Estate License Studies. I am Nigerian by birth but have recently become a Canadian citizen. I love to travel and am fascinated with different types of culture and language. I am specifically infatuated with Eastern Asian culture and am currently studying the Japanese language. I most recently started writing a graphic novel involving many characters from different myths and legends including characters in my portfolio below. I am adept at graphic design and digital creation and hope to someday share this work with the world!
                Some of my many achievements include  a recent $2000 schlarship, developing my own NFTs and digital arts and being Time's Person of the Year in 2006.
